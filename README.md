iLcatraz
========

iTunes REST server to help your escape Apples's jail. 

Generally you do not need this package, it has nothing useful by itself.
The others guys may ask you to install the iLcatrase to make their applications to run.

Anyway if you know you need this server just instal it, set preferences from the simple menu and access http://localhost:[configured port]/help

Pay attention it's VERY limited. Memory leaks, poor performance, may crash on few requests in time.


It requires Mac OS X above 10.6, although you may try to solve the issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18917278/base-lproj-mainmenu-xib-is-not-available-when-compiling-for-targets-before-mac-o and i belive it will run on 10.6.

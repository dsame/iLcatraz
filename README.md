iLcatraz
========

iTunes REST server escapes you from Aplles's jail. I hope.

Generally you do not need this package, it has nothing useful by itself, the others guys may ask you to  the iLcatraze to make their applications to run.

Anyway if you feel you need this server just instal it, set preferences and access http://localhost:[configured port]/help

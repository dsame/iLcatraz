iLcatraz
========

iTunes REST server to help your escape Aplles's jail. 

Generally you do not need this package, it has nothing useful by itself.
The others guys may ask you to install the iLcatrase to make their applications to run.

Anyway if you know you need this server just instal it, set preferences from the simple menu and access http://localhost:[configured port]/help
